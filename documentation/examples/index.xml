      <description>One reason to model systems is to gain insight into and predict complex behavior. Ideally, the components of the system are reasonably easy to understand in isolation, while assembling them together results in surprising behavior that can provide insight or support for a theory about the whole system.
The Monty Hall Problem The Monty Hall problem (Monty Hall problem - Wikipedia) states:
 Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re on a game show, and you&amp;rsquo;re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Visualizing Calendar Time</title>

      <description>ABS provides a logical clock, a rational-valued global counter starting at 0 &amp;ndash; see the Timed ABS chapter of the manual for details. This example shows how to use ABS to run simulations modeling real (calendar) time and visualize the resulting data in a timeline.
The code can be found at https://github.com/abstools/absexamples/tree/master/collaboratory/examples/time-and-date/
Modeling Time in ABS The following short ABS model creates a list of values together with the time when the value was produced.</description>
