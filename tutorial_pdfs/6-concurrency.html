<h3>6 The Concurrency Layers</h3>
<h4>6.1 Background</h4>
One of the most distinctive features of ABS is its concurrency model. If we
look at commercial programming languages such as C, C++, or Java, one can
observe that, despite intense efforts in the last decade, none of them has a fully
formalized concurrency model. Even though there are promising efforts towards
a formal concurrency model of Java <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2103776.2103785">[5]</a>, the details are so complex that they
are likely to compromise usability of any resulting system. The reason is that
current industrial programming languages have a very low-level concurrency
model and do not natively support distributed computation. This has practical
consequences, such as burdening the programmer with, for example, prevention
of data races.
A more fundamental problem is the impossibility to design a compositional
proof system for such languages. By <em>compositionality</em> we mean that one can
specify and verify the behavior of a single method in isolation from the rest
of the system. This is a prerequisite for being able to deduce global behavior
from the composition of local behavior. In a setting, where concurrent objects
can arbitrarily cross-reference each other, this is hardly possible. Arbitrarily

complex, global invariants, might be needed to describe behavior. One approach
to tackle the problem is to impose structure on concurrent objects and to make
their dependencies syntactically explicit. In the realm of Java, JCoBox <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14107-2_13">[39]</a> is a
suitable framework. It has been simplified and renamed into <em>Concurrent Object
Group</em> (COG) in the context of ABS. COGs constitute the <em>lower tier</em> of the ABS
concurrency model and are intended for closely cooperating concurrent tasks.
A second shortcoming of mainstream programming languages is the lack
of support for distributed computation, that is, asynchronous communication
among nodes that do not share memory. This form of concurrency has been
abstracted into the <em>Actor</em> model <a href="http://ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-73/PDF/027B.pdf">[23]</a> and is realized with first-class support
in recent languages such as Scala. ABS implements a version of Actor-based
distributed computation where COGs form the primitive units of distribution.
This constitutes the <em>upper</em> tier of the ABS concurrency model. Its main ideas
are derived from the modeling language Creol <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2006.07.031">[26]</a>.
<h4>6.2 Component Object Groups</h4>
An ABS Concurrent Object Group (COG) is a collection of tasks with shared
memory and processor. This means that exactly one task is active at any given
time and tasks can cross-reference each other. The situation can be visualized
as in <a href="fig6.png">Fig. 6</a>.
Within a COG, synchronous as well as asynchronous method calls are permit-
ted. For the former, we use the standard syntax <strong>target.method(arg1,arg2,...)</strong>.
<em>Synchronous method calls</em> within COGs represent sequential execution of code,
that is, they block the caller and execute the code of the target until control is
returned.
<em>Asynchronous method calls</em> use the syntax <strong>target!method(arg1,arg2,...)</strong> and
they cause the creation of a new task that is to execute the code of the target.
Unlike in synchronous calls, execution of the code of the caller continues.
The main point to understand about COGs is that multitasking is not <em>pre-
emptive</em> (decided by a scheduler). Rather it is an explicit decision of the ABS
modeler when control is transferred to another task. To this end, ABS provides
scheduling statements that allow <em>cooperative multitasking</em>. In between the ex-
plicit scheduling points, only one task is active, signified by the (single) <em>lock</em> of
a COG being set to &amp;#8868. As a consequence, data races between synchronization
points simply cannot happen, which was an important design goal of ABS.
<h4>6.3 Scheduling and Synchronization</h4>
So, how are scheduling points specified in ABS? It is here that we encounter a
second, central concurrency principle of ABS: <em>communication and synchroniza-
tion are decoupled</em>. This is done via <em>future types</em> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-71316-6_22">[12]</a>. For any ABS type <strong>T</strong> a legal
type name is <strong>Fut&lt;T&gt;</strong> and one can assign to it the result of any asynchronous
method call with return type <strong>T</strong>. A variable declared with type <strong>Fut&lt;T&gt;</strong> serves as
a reference to the future result of an asynchronous call and allows to retrieve it
once it will have been computed. For example, the final line of the example on
p. 15 can be rewritten to:
<pre>Fut&lt;Customer&gt; e = c!findCustomer(l);
&lt;do something else&gt;</pre>
Now the call creates a new task in the current COG and declares <strong>e</strong> as a future
reference to its final result. The following code is executed immediately.
The future mechanism allows to dispatch asynchronous calls, continue with
the execution, and then synchronize on the result, whenever it is needed. Syn-
chronization is achieved by the command <strong>await g</strong>, where <strong>g</strong> is a polling <em>guard</em>.
A guard is a conjunction of either side-effect free boolean expressions or <em>future
guards</em> of the form <strong>f?</strong>. In the latter, <strong>f</strong> is a variable that has a future type. If
the result to which <strong>f?</strong> is a reference is ready and available, then the expression
evaluates to true. When the guard of an await statement evaluates to true, the
computation simply continues. If, however, a guard is not true, then the current
task releases the lock of its COG and gives another task in that COG the chance
to continue. When later the task is scheduled gain, the guard is re-evaluated,
and so on, until it finally becomes true. We call this a <em>conditional scheduling
point</em> or <em>conditional release point</em>. To continue the previous example we could
write:
<pre>await e?;</pre>
If the asynchronous call to <strong>findCustomer(l)</strong> has finished, then execution sim-
ply continues. Otherwise, the lock of the current COG is set to ⊥ and the pro-
cessor is free to proceed with another task. For efficiency reasons ABS allows
only <em>monotonic</em> guards and only conjunctive composition. Once the result from
an asynchronous call is available, it can be retrieved with a <strong>get</strong>-expression that
has a future variable as its argument. In the example this may look as follows:
<pre>Customer f = e.get;</pre>
In summary, the following programming idiom for asynchronous calls and
retrieving their results is common in ABS:
<pre>Fut&lt;T&gt; v = o!m(e); ... ; await v?; r = v.get;</pre>
ABS does not attempt to check that each <strong>get</strong> expression is guarded by an
<strong>await</strong> statement. So what happens when the result of an asynchronous call is

<a href="fig7.png"><img src="fig7-433x133.png" alt="fig7-433x133" width="455" height="131" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-752" /></a>

<strong>Fig. 7.</strong> Illustration of object and COG creation (gray boundaries represent COGs)

not ready when <strong>get</strong> is executed? The answer is that the execution of the COG
<em>blocks</em>. The difference between suspension and blocking is that in the latter case
<em>no</em> task in same COG can continue until the blocking future is resolved.
Sometimes it is convenient to create an <em>unconditional scheduling point</em>, for
example, to insert release points into long running sequential tasks. The syntax
for unconditional scheduling statements in ABS is “<strong>suspend;</strong>”.
<h4>6.4 Object and COG Creation</h4>
In the previous section we discussed the fundamental concurrency model of ABS,
which is based on COGs. Whenever we create an object with the <strong>new</strong> statement,
it is by default created in the same COG as the current task (see upper part
of <a href="fig7.png">Fig. 7</a>). This is not adequate for modeling <em>distributed computing</em>, where each
node has its own computing resources (processor) and nodes are loosely coupled.
In an ABS model of a distributed scenario we associate one COG with each
node. New COGs are implicitly created when specifying the <strong>cog</strong> keyword at
object creation (see lower part of <a href="fig7.png">Fig. 7</a>): this creates a new COG and places the
new object inside it. At the moment, COGs are not first-class objects in ABS
and are accessible only implicitly through their objects.(Foot: There is an extension for ABS runtime objects that allows explicit and dynamic
grouping of COGs <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34026-0_6">[28]</a>.) As a consequence, it is
not possible to re-enter via recursive calls into the same execution thread. This
is the reason why a simple binary lock for each COG is sufficient. Let us extend
our running example with an <strong>Account</strong> class and COG creation:
<pre>module Account;
interface Account {
   Int getAid();
   Int deposit(Int x);
   Int withdraw(Int x);
}

class AccountImpl(Int aid, Int balance, Customer owner)
implements Account { ... }</pre>

<a href="ABSDebugPerspective.jpg"><img src="ABSDebugPerspective-424x270.jpg" alt="ABSDebugPerspective-424x270" width="424" height="270" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-756" /></a>

<strong>Fig. 8.</strong> Screenshot of ABS Debug Perspective in Eclipse plugin
<pre>{
   [Near] Customer c = new CorpIndvCustomerImpl(3);
   [Far] Account a = new cog AccountImpl(1,0,c);
   Fut&lt;Int&gt; dep = a!deposit(17);
   Fut&lt;Int&gt; with = a!withdraw(17);
   await dep? &amp; with?;
   Int x = dep.get;
   Int y = with.get;
   Int net = x + y;
}</pre>
We create an account objects in a different COG from the current one. Note
that there is no sharing of objects between COGs, so that the variable c provides
no alias to the object parameter c in the constructor <strong>AccountImpl(1,0,c)</strong>. The
tasks resulting from the two asynchronous calls will be executed on the same
node, which is different from the current one. A conjunctive guard ensures that
the retrieval of the results is safe.
It is possible to <em>visualize</em> the execution of ABS code in two ways. To start
the graphical ABS Debugger, simply right click on the file with the <strong>Account</strong>
module in the explorer and select <strong>Run As|ABS Java Backend (Debug)</strong>. This will
automatically switch to the ABS Debug Perspective (see <a href="ABSDebugPerspective.jpg">Fig. 8</a>) and start the

<a href="ABSSequenceDiagram.jpg"><img src="ABSSequenceDiagram-338x315.jpg" alt="ABSSequenceDiagram-338x315" width="338" height="315" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-758" /></a>

<strong>Fig. 9.</strong> Sequence diagram generated from an ABS simulation

Eclipse debugger. All the usual features of a graphical debugger are available:
navigation, breakpoints, state inspection, etc.
If instead, the backend <strong>Run As|ABS Java Backend (Debug with Sequence Di-
agram)</strong> is chosen, then in addition a UML sequence diagram that has a lifeline
for each created COG is created and dynamically updated after each debugger
step, see <a href="ABSSequenceDiagram.jpg">Fig. 9</a>.
Synchronous method calls to targets not in the current COG make no sense
and are forbidden. For example, if we replace one of the asynchronous calls above
with <strong>a.deposit(17)</strong>, a runtime error results. One possibility to avoid this is to
<em>annotate</em> declarations with one of the types <strong>Near</strong> or <strong>Far</strong>, as shown above. This
tells the compiler that, for example, <strong>a</strong> is in a different COG and cannot be the
target of a synchronous call. Obviously, it is tedious to annotate all declarations;
moreover, the annotations tend to clutter the models. To address this problem,
ABS implements a far/near analysis, which automatically <em>infers</em> a safely approx-
imated (in case of doubt, use “far”) location type <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21952-8_15">[41]</a>. The inferred types are
displayed in the Eclipse editor as superscripts (“N” for near, “F” for far) above
the declared types. All annotations in the example can be inferred automati-
cally: simply delete the annotations to see it. It is also possible to annotate a
declaration with <strong>Somewhere</strong>, which overrides the type inference mechanism and
tells the compiler not to make any assumptions. Default is the annotation <strong>Infer</strong>,
but this can be changed in the ABS project properties.
It is entirely possible that execution of an ABS model results in a <em>deadlock</em>
during runtime, as is exemplified by the model in Fig. 10. Objects <strong>c</strong>, <strong>e</strong> and <strong>d</strong> are
in different COGs, say cog_c and cog_d . The task that executes <strong>m1</strong> is in cog_c while
the task executing <strong>m2</strong> is put into the second COG cog_d . During this execution <strong>m3</strong>
is called on <strong>e</strong>, which is located in the first COG cog_c . For <strong>m3</strong> to proceed it needs
to obtain the lock of cog_c , but this is not possible, because <strong>m1</strong> still waits for the
result of <strong>m2</strong>. Hence, neither COG can progress.
Deadlocks are very difficult to avoid in general. Deadlock-free concurrent
languages tend to be too restrictive to be usable and, unlike data race-freeness,
<pre>class C {
   C m1(C b, C c) { Fut&lt;C&gt; r = b!m2(c); return r.get; }
   C m2(C c) { Fut&lt;C&gt; r = c!m3(); return r.get; }
   C m3() { return new C(); }
}
{
   C c = new C(); C d = new cog C(); C e = new C();
   c!m1(d,e);
}</pre>
<strong>Fig. 10.</strong> Example for deadlock in ABS

are not a practical option. In ABS many deadlocks can be avoided by supplying
enough release points. In the example above it is sufficient to guard one of the
<strong>get</strong> expressions. In addition, there is an automatic deadlock analysis for ABS <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21461-5_11">[18]</a>
that is currently being implemented.
<h4>6.5 Formal Semantics of Concurrent ABS</h4>
The ABS language has a mathematically rigorous, SOS-style semantics <a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/Deliverable12.pdf">[13,</a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_8"> 25]</a>.
This tutorial introduction is not the place go into the details, but we sketch
the main ideas. The central issue is to give an appropriate structure to the
terms that represent ABS <em>runtime configurations</em>. They are collections over the
following items:

<a href="6.5.cogs_.png"><img src="6.5.cogs_412x114.png" alt="6.5.cogs_412x114" width="412" height="114" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-760" /></a>

<strong>COGs</strong> are identified simply by a name <em>b</em> for their <em>lock</em> whose value can be either
&amp;#8868 or ⊥.
<strong>Objects</strong> have a name <em>o</em>, need to have a reference to their COG <em>b</em>, to their class
<em>C</em>, and they also have a local state σ that holds the current field values.
<strong>Tasks</strong> have a name n, a reference to their COG b and to the object o whose code
they are executing. They also have a state σ withe values of local variables
and a <em>program counter s</em> that gives the next executable instruction. Task
names <em>n</em> also double as futures, because they contain exactly the required
information.

A runtime configuration may consist of any number of the above items. The
operational semantics of ABS is given by rewrite rules that match the next
executable statement of a task (and thereby also the current COG and object).
A typical example is the rewrite rule that realizes <em>creation of a new COG</em>:

<a href="6.5.formula.png"><img src="6.5.formula-388x37.png" alt="6.5.formula-388x37" width="388" height="37" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-762" /></a>

where:
–<a href="6.5.where_.1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-623" alt="6.5.where.1" src="where_.1.png" width="57" height="18" /></a> new;
–<a href="6.5.where_.2.1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-629" alt="6.5.where.2.1" src="6.5.where_.2.1.png" width="41" height="21" /></a> init block of class <em>C</em> and <a href="6.5.where_.2.2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-630" alt="6.5.where.2.2" src="6.5.where_.2.2.png" width="31" height="18" /></a> binds constructor parameters <a href="6.5.where_.2.3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-631" alt="6.5.where.2.3" src="6.5.where_.2.3.png" width="18" height="13" /></a>
–<a href="6.5.where_.3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-628" alt="6.5.where.3" src="6.5.where_.3.png" width="73" height="21" /></a>
–<a href="6.5.where_.4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-626" alt="6.5.where.4" src="6.5.where_.4.png" width="175" height="15" /></a>

The rule matches a new cog statement in task n, COG b, current object o,
and subsequent statements s. First we need to create a new COG with a fresh
name b and a new object o in class C. The new COG starts immediately to
execute the initialization code of its class C in a new task n , therefore, b ’s lock
is set to . Note that the current object this must be instantiated now to the
actual object o . After initialization, execution is suspended. The original task n
immediately continues to execute the remaining code as there is no release point
here. The value of the object reference z is replaced with the new object o .
