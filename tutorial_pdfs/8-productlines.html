<h3>8 Product Line Modeling with ABS</h3>
<h4>8.1 Product Line Engineering</h4>
One of the aims of ABS is to provide a uniform and formal framework for
product line engineering (PLE) <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-28901-1">[35]</a>, a practically highly successful software reuse
methodology. In PLE one distinguishes two separate development phases (see
<a href="fig11.png">Fig. 11</a>).
During family engineering one attempts to distill the commonality among
different products into a set of reusable artifacts. At the same time, the variability
of the product line is carefully planned. This is typically done in a feature-driven
manner, and the relation of features, as well as constraints in their combination is
documented in a feature model with the help of feature description languages <a href="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/RE.2006.23">[40]</a>.
In the application engineering phase, individual products are being built by
selecting features and by combining the artifacts that implement them in a
suitable way.
One drawback of current practice in PLE is that feature description languages
make no formal connection between features and their implementation. This
renders products assembly ad hoc and error-prone. That issue is addressed in
ABS with language extensions for modeling of features, for connecting features
to their realization, as well as for feature selection and product specification <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11">[10]</a>.
In this section we introduce the PLE extensions of ABS. A fuller discussion of
various approaches to achieve greater flexibility in object-oriented modeling is
contained in the chapter by Clarke in this volume <a href="http://ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-73/PDF/027B.pdf ">[8]</a>.
If one wants to maintain a connection between features and code, then the
central issue are the mechanisms being used to compose the code corresponding
to new features with the existing code. In current practice, this is often done by
“glue code” written in scripting languages. ABS has the ambition that models
can be statically analyzed. This means that the feature composition mechanism
must be well-structured and represent a suitable match for the analysis methods
used in ABS <a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/Deliverable27.pdf">[14]</a>. Such a mechanism is delta-oriented programming (DOP) <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-15579-6_6">[36,</a>
<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-557/paper3.pdf ">38]</a>, because it allows to modify object-oriented code in a structured manner at

specification approach in ABS <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34026-0_4">[21]</a>.
To summarize, the ABS-extensions used to model product lines consist of
four elements <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21455-4_13">[9,</a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11"> 10]</a>, which we describe now in turn:
<ol>
	<li>A feature description language</li>
	<li>A language for deltas that modify ABS models</li>
	<li>A configuration language connecting features with the deltas that realize
them</li>
	<li>A language for product configuration</li>
</ol>
<h4>8.2 Feature Description</h4>
Modern software development processes, notably agile processes and PLE, tend
to be feature-driven. A number of mature and useful formalisms for feature
description have been developed in the last decade. For ABS we use a slight
modification of the textual variability language (TVL) <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2010.10.005">[11]</a>, which has the ad-
vantage of having a formal semantics and a textual representation. The feature
description language used in ABS is called μTVL and differs from TVL in that
(i) attribute types that are not needed are omitted and (ii) the possibility to
have multiple root features. These are useful to model orthogonal variability in
product lines.
Let us build a product line based on the Account interface from Sect. 6.4. As-
sume we want to distinguish between checking and saving accounts. The latter
may pay interest, whereas the former usually don’t. Optionally, a checking ac-
count (but not a saving account) may permit an overdraft or incur fees for trans-
actions. A graphical representation of the Account feature model is in <a href="fig12.png">Fig. 12</a>.
The textual rendering in μTVL looks as follows:
<pre>root Account {
   group allof {
      Type {
         group oneof {
            Check {ifin: Type.i == 0;},
            Save {ifin: Type.i &gt; 0;
            exclude: Overdraft;}
         }
         Int i; // interest rate
      },
      opt Fee {Int amount in [0..5];},
      opt Overdraft
   }
}</pre>
n μTVL one represents each subhierarchy in the feature tree by a group
of features, which can be further qualified as inclusive (allof) or alternative
(oneof). Within a group there is a comma-separated list of feature declarations.
Each feature declaration may be optional (opt) and have restrictions (ifin:), ex-
clusions (exclude:), or requirements (include:). Feature parameters are declared
after the declaration of a subhierarchy. A feature model appears in a separate
file with extension .abs. The Eclipse editor supports syntax and parse error
highlighting. There can be several feature files with feature declarations. These
are interpreted as orthogonal feature hierarchies that are all part of the same
feature model.
The semantics of feature models is straightforward by translation into a
boolean/integer constraint formula, see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11">[10,</a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2010.10.005"> 11]</a>. For example, the feature model
above is characterized by the following formula:

0 ≤ Account ≤ 1 ∧ Type → Account ∧
Overdraft† → Account ∧ Fee† → Account ∧
Type + Fee† + Overdraft† = 3 ∧ 0 ≤ Type ≤ 1 ∧
Check → Type ∧ Save → Type ∧ Save → ¬Overdraft ∧
Check + Save = 1 ∧
0 ≤ Check ≤ 1 ∧ 0 ≤ Save ≤ 1 ∧ 0 ≤ Fee† ≤ 1 ∧ 0 ≤ Overdraft† ≤ 1 ∧
Fee → Fee† ∧ Overdraft → Overdraft† ∧
0 ≤ Save ≤ 1 ∧ 0 ≤ Check ≤ 1 ∧
Fee → (Fee.amount &gt;= 0 ∧ Fee.amount &lt;= 5) ∧
Check → (Type.i = 0) ∧ Save → (Type.i &gt; 0).

It is easy to check validity of a given feature selection for a feature model F : for
any selected feature f and parameter value p := v one simply adds f = 1 ∧ p = v
to the semantics of F and checks for satisfiability with a constraint solver. The
constraint solver of ABS can:
<ul>
	<li>find all possible solutions for a given feature model and</li>
	<li>check whether a feature selection is a solution of a feature model.</li>
</ul>

The latter check is performed implicitly in the ABS Eclipse plugin, whenever
the user requests to build a product based on a specific feature selection (see
Sect. 8.5).
<h4>8.3 Delta Modeling</h4>
As mentioned above, the realization of features in ABS is done with delta mod-
ules (or deltas, for short), a variant of delta-oriented programming (DOP). This
constitutes the main reuse principle of ABS and replaces other mechanisms such
as code inheritance, traits, or mixins.
In delta modeling we assume that one outcome of the family engineering
phase (see <a href="fig11.png">Fig. 11</a>) is a core or base product with minimal functionality. Product
variants with additional features are obtained from it by applying one or more
deltas that realize the desired features, as illustrated in <a href="fig13.png">Fig. 13</a>. In ABS, deltas
have the following capabilities:

– Delta modules may add, remove or modify classes and interfaces
– Permitted class modifications are:
• adding and removal of fields
• adding, removal and modification of methods
• extending the list of implemented interfaces

The actual reuse mechanism is located in the modification of methods: the
description of a method modification in a delta can access the most recent in-
carnation of that method in a previous delta by the statement original(...);.
This will cause the compiler to insert the body of the referred method at the
time when the deltas are applied. The signature of original() must be iden-
tical to the one of the modified method. The compiler checks the applicability
of deltas and ensures well-typedness of the resulting code. It is because of this
reuse mechanism that once can say that the granularity of delta application is
at the level of methods.
There is a certain analogy between original() in DOP and super()-calls in
OO languages with code inheritance. The crucial difference is that original()
references are resolved at compile time (product build time), while super()-calls
occur at runtime. As a consequence, there is a runtime penalty for the latter.
Assume we have the following implementation of the withdraw(Int) method
of the Account interface, which ensures that we cannot withdraw more than the
current balance:
<pre>class AccountImpl(Int aid, Int balance, Customer owner)
implements Account {
   Int withdraw(Int x) {
      if (balance - x &gt;= 0) { balance = balance - x; }
      return balance;
   }
}</pre>
Now we would like to create a delta module that realizes the feature Fee. We
need to modify withdraw(Int), which can be achieved by the following delta:
<pre>delta DFee(Int fee); // Implements feature Fee
uses Account;
modifies class AccountImpl {
   modifies Int withdraw(Int x) {
      Int result = x;
      if (x&gt;=fee) result = original(x+fee);
      return result;
   }
}</pre>
One or more features can be put into a file with extension .abs. The con-
nection between different deltas and a base implementation is given via the uses
clause that refers to the module where the base is found. Like classes, deltas can
have parameters, however, these are not fields, but are instantiated at product
build time. Normally, there is a correspondence between the parameters of deltas
and those of the features they are supposed to implement.
The modified withdraw(Int) method is implemented by a suitable call to the
original version after a check that the withdrawn amount is not trivially small.
We must declare a result variable to ensure that the return statement is last.
Assume further we want to realize the Save feature. One must ensure that
the interest rate is set to 0. ABS deltas at this time do not support to add or
modify class initialization blocks. To change the initial value of a field, we simply
remove the field declaration and add it again with a suitable initial value:
<pre>delta DSave(Int i); // Implements feature Save
uses Account;
modifies class AccountImpl {
   removes Int interest;
   adds Int interest = i;
}</pre>
Of course, we assume here that the interest field has been added in the
first place in the earlier delta DType. This requires to specify and check temporal
constraints on the application of deltas as we shall see in the following section.
Application of a concrete delta is illustrated with DSave in <a href="fig14.png">Fig. 14</a>.
Syntax and parse error highlighting for delta modules works as usual. Auto-
matic completion works as well, but it is only done relative to the base product.

<strong>Fig. 15.</strong> Schema of product line configuration in ABS

The reason is that before product build time, the compiler cannot know which
deltas have been applied before. For the same reason, only a limited amount of
type checking is done. Research to lift type checking to the family level is under
way <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2110147.2110161">[29,</a><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00236-012-0173-z"> 37]</a>.
<h4>8.4 Product Line Configuration</h4>
So far, we have two models relating to product lines: the feature model and the
delta model, that is, the feature implementation. Unlike any other formalism we
are aware of, in ABS we can make a formal connection between these. This is
the key to being able to analyze whole product lines and not merely individual
products.

In ABS, the connection between features and their realization (illustrated
in <a href="fig15.png">Fig. 15</a>) is done in a dedicated product line configuration file. This makes
debugging easy, because all information about the realization of a given feature
model is collected in one place. To establish a connection between features and
deltas, the configuration files need to specify three things:
<ol>
	<li>they must associate features with their implementing delta modules by ap-
plication conditions;</li>
	<li>they need to resolve conflicts in the application order by giving partial tem-
poral constraints on delta application;</li>
	<li>they need to pass the attribute values of features to the parameters of the
delta modules.</li>
</ol>
We can illustrate all three aspects with our running example. The following
file (again, use file extension .abs) defines a product line named Accounts based
on the five features of the feature model in<a href="fig12.png"> Fig. 12</a>.
<pre>productline Accounts;
features Type, Fee, Overdraft, Check, Save;
delta DType (Type.i) when Type;
delta DFee (Fee.amount) when Fee;
delta DOverdraft after DCheck when Overdraft;
delta DSave (Type.i) after DType when Save;
delta DCheck after DType when Check;</pre>
For each delta that is to be used for implementing any of the features one
specifies:
<ul>
	<li>the application conditions (when clauses), that is, the feature(s) that are be-
ing realized by each delta and whose presence triggers delta application;</li>
	<li>the delta parameters which are derived from feature attribute values;</li>
	<li>a strict partial order of delta application (after clauses) to ensure well-de-
finedness of delta applications and resolve conflicts.</li>
</ul>
In the example, there is a one-to-one correspondence between deltas and
features, which is reflected in the application conditions. Likewise, the feature
attributes Type.i and Fee.amount directly can be used as parameters of the cor-
responding deltas. The temporal constraints of DSave and DCheck ensure that the
field interest is present. The constraint of DOverdraft makes sure that this delta
is only applied to checking accounts. It would also have been possible to express
this constraint at the level of the feature model with an includes: clause. It is up
to the modeler to decide whether a given constraint is a property of the feature
model or of the product line.
<h4>8.5 Product Selection</h4>
The final step in PLE with ABS is product selection. Whereas the activities that
took place until now can be viewed as mostly being part of family engineering,
the selection process is always part of application engineering.

<a href="fig16.png"><img src="fig16-415x240.png" alt="fig16-415x240" width="415" height="240" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-768" /></a>

<strong>Fig. 16.</strong> The role of product line configuration in product selection and compilation

To create a product it is sufficient to list the features that should be realized
in it and to instantiate the feature attributes with concrete values. The syntax
is very simple and self-explaining. As any other ABS file, product selection files
have the .abs extension and there is Eclipse support for syntax and parse error
highlighting. Some examples for the Accounts product line are as follows:
<pre>product CheckingAccount (Type{i=0},Check);
product AccountWithFee (Type{i=0},Check,Fee{amount=1});
product AccountWithOverdraft (Type{i=0},Check,Overdraft);
product SavingWithOverdraft (Type{i=1},Save,Overdraft);</pre>
The simplest product that can be built is CheckingAccount. The second prod-
uct above extends it by charging a fee of one unit per transaction. The ABS
compiler uses the product selection file and the other related files to create a
“flattened” ABS model where all deltas have been applied such that it contains
only core ABS code. In a first step, the compiler checks that the product selec-
tion is valid for the given feature model as described in Sect. 8.2. It then uses the
product line configuration file to decide which deltas need to be applied and how
they are instantiated. The partial order on the deltas is linearized. It is up to
the modeller to ensure (possibly, by adding temporal constraints) that different
linearizations do not lead to conflicting results. Finally, the resulting core ABS
model is type-checked and compiled to one of the ABS backends in the standard
way. As all parts of the ABS language the product line modeling languages have
a formal semantics—the details are found in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11">[10]</a>.
Different products can be selected in the Run|Run Configurations ... dialog
from the ABS Product menu. Invalid product selections or type errors in the
configuration files will be displayed at this stage. For example, selection of the
SavingWithOverdraft product above results in an error, because the constraints
in the feature model are not satisfied. After selection of a valid product one

<a href="fig17.png"><img src="fig17-415x253.png" alt="fig17-415x253" width="415" height="253" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-769" /></a>

<strong>Fig. 17.</strong> Choice of different layers when modeling with ABS

can run and debug the resulting core ABS model as described earlier. The ABS
compiler additionally creates always as base product that corresponds to the
given ABS model without any features or deltas. This product appears under
the name &lt;base&gt; in the product selection menu.
If we execute the main class of the Account module in Sect. 6.4 in the base
product, we obtain the result 37 in the variable net, whereas if we run the
product AccountWithFee, we obtain 34.
A current limitation of the Eclipse ABS plugin is that the debugger correctly
displays the runtime configuration and the values of variables of products, but
in the editor window only the core product is displayed.
