<h3>5 The OO-Imperative Layer</h3>
<h4>5.1 The Object Model</h4>
ABS follows a strict <em>programming to interfaces</em> discipline <a href="http://st-www.cs.illinois.edu/patterns/dpbook/dpbook.html">[17]</a>. This means that
the <em>only</em> declaration types of objects are interface types. Consequentially, ABS
classes do <em>not</em> give rise to type names.
Apart from that, interface declarations are pretty standard and follow a
Java-like syntax. They simply consist of a number of method signatures. Static
fields are not permitted,(Foot: And neither are static classes and objects. Instead of static elements the ABS modeler
should consider to use ADTs and functions.) but subinterfaces, even multiple subinterfaces, are per-
mitted. Let us give an example that models the Customer type from previous
sections in an object-oriented fashion:
<pre>module CustomerIF;
export Customer;
import Level, createLevel from CustomerData;
interface Customer { Int getId(); }
interface IndvCustomer extends Customer {}
interface CorpCustomer extends Customer { Level getLevel(); }</pre>
As can be seen, interfaces (and also classes) can be exported. In fact, this is
necessary, if anyone outside their modules is to use them.
It is possible to mix object and data types: data types may occur anywhere
within classes and interfaces as long as they are well-typed. Less obviously, ref-
erence types may also occur inside algebraic data types. As seen earlier, it is
perfectly possible to declare the following type:
<pre>type CustomerList = List&lt;Customer&gt;;</pre>
Keep in mind, though, that it is not allowed to call methods in function
definitions. The reason is that method calls might have side effects.
It was mentioned already that classes do not provide type names. They are
only used for object construction. As a consequence, in ABS it is always possible
to decide when a class and when an interface name is expected. Therefore, inter-
faces and classes may have the same name. We do not recommend this, however,
because it dilutes the programming to interfaces discipline. It is suggested to use
a base name for the interface and derive class names by appending “Impl” or
similar.

A class may implement multiple interfaces. Class constructors are not de-
clared explicitly, instead, class declarations are equipped with parameter dec-
larations that implicitly define corresponding fields and a constructor. Class
definitions then consist of field declarations, followed by an initialization block
and method implementations. Any of these elements may be missing. Hence, we
can continue the example as follows:
<pre>class CorpIndvCustomerImpl(Int id)
implements IndvCustomer, CorpCustomer{
   Level lv = createLevel();
   // no initialization block
   Level getLevel() { return lv; }
   Int getId() { return id; }
}</pre>
Here, the <strong>id</strong> field is modeled as a class parameter, because it is not possible to
give a reasonable default value, which is otherwise required, because fields that
have no reference type must be initialized. Reference type fields are initialized
with <strong>null</strong>.
In contrast to functions, method names need not (and cannot) be exported
by modules. It is sufficient to get hold of an object in order to obtain access to
the methods that are defined in its type.
The most striking difference between ABS and mainstream OO languages is
that in ABS there is <em>no class inheritance</em> and, therefore, also <em>no code inheritance</em>.
So, how do we achieve code reuse? In ABS we decided to disentangle data design
and functionality from the modeling of code variability. For the former, we use
functions and objects (without code inheritance), whereas for the latter we use
a layer on top of the core ABS language that permits to connect directly with
feature models. This layer is discussed in Sect. 8.
In a concurrent setting (see Sect. 6) one typically wants some objects to
start their activity immediately after initialization. To achieve this in ABS, one
can define a <strong>Unit run()</strong> method, which implicitly declares a class as <em>active</em> and
lets objects execute the code in the body of the run method after initialization.
Classes without a <strong>run()</strong> method are called <em>passive</em> and their objects react only
to incoming calls.
<h4>5.2 The Imperative Layer</h4>
ABS has standard statements for sequential composition, assignment, while-
loops, conditionals, synchronous method calls, and method return. To illus-
trate all of these, one can look at the implementation of method <strong>findCustomer(
CustomerList)</strong> in class <strong>CorpIndvCustomerImpl</strong> (don’t forget to add it to the im-
plemented interfaces as well to render it visible!).
<pre>Customer findCustomer(CustomerList cl) {
   Customer result;
   Int i = 0;
   while (i&lt;length(cl)) {
      Customer curCust = nth(cl,i);
      Int curId = curCust.getId();
      if (id==curId) {result = curCust;}
   }
return result;
}</pre>
In addition to the various constructs, we can illustrate several ABS-specific
restrictions: it is necessary that the final statement in the method body is a
return statement with the correct type. A typical ABS idiom is, therefore, to
declare a local <strong>result</strong> variable. Neither for-loops nor breaks from loops are sup-
ported at the moment. To avoid going through the remaining list after the ele-
ment has been found, one would need to add and test for a <strong>Bool found</strong> variable.
Complex expressions are not allowed at the moment in tests of conditionals or
loops. The workaround, as shown here, is to declare a local variable that holds
an intermediate result. While these restrictions can be slightly annoying they
hardly matter very much. It is likely that some of them will be lifted in the
future, once it is better known what modelers wish.
A more fundamental restriction concerns the usage of fields in assignment
statements: assignments to fields and field lookups are only possible for the
current object. Given a field <strong>f</strong>, an assignment of the form <strong>x = f;</strong> is always
implicitly qualified as <strong>x = this.f;</strong> and an assignment of the form <strong>f = exp;</strong> is
always implicitly qualified as <strong>this.f = exp;</strong>. This implies that fields in ABS are
<em>object private</em>. They cannot be directly seen or be modified by other objects,
not even by objects from the same class (as is possible even for private fields in
Java). In other words, ABS enforces <em>strong encapsulation</em> of objects: it is only
possible to view or change the state of another object via getter- and setter-
methods. For example, it is not possible to change the second line in the body
of the while-loop of <strong>findCustomer(CustomerList)</strong> as follows:
<pre>Int curId = curCust.id;</pre>
The designers of ABS consider object encapsulation not as a restriction, but
as a virtue: it makes all cross references between objects syntactically explicit.
This avoids errors that can be hard to find. In addition it makes static analysis
much more efficient, because any cross reference and possible side effect to a
different object can be associated with a unique method contract.
For the practicing ABS modeler object encapsulation is greatly alleviated by
the method completion feature of the Eclipse editor: if one types the beginning
of the example above “<strong>Int curId = curCust</strong>.”, then a pop-up menu will offer a
selection of all methods that are known for objects of type <strong>Customer</strong>, the required
getter-method <strong>getId()</strong> among them. If a suitable method is not found, then the
modeler can take this as a hint that it needs to be implemented or added to the
interface.
ABS is a <em>block-structured</em> language. Blocks are delimited by curly braces (no
semicolon afterward) and may appear at four different places in a program:
<ol>
	<li>as a way to group several statements and provide a scope for local variables—
blocks are necessary for bodies of loops and conditionals that have more than
one statement;</li>
	<li>as method bodies;</li>
	<li>as the (optional) class initialization block, between field and method decla-
rations;</li>
	<li>as an (optional) implicit “main” method at end of a module.</li>
</ol>
The last usage serves as an entry point for execution of ABS programs. At
least one main block in one module is necessary for executing an ABS project,
otherwise it is not clear which objects are to be created and executed. Any
module that has a main block is selectable as an execution target via the Eclipse
<strong>Run Configurations ...</strong> dialog or simply by right clicking on the desired module
in the explorer and selection of <strong>Run As</strong>. We might complete the example by
specifying the following main block for module <strong>CustomerIF</strong>:
<pre>{
   Customer c = new CorpIndvCustomerImpl(17); // create some customers
   Customer d = new CorpIndvCustomerImpl(16);
   CustomerList l = Cons(c,Cons(d,Nil)); // create list of customers
   Customer e = c.findCustomer(l); // we should find c in l
}</pre>
This code illustrates at the same time the usage of the <strong>new</strong> statement, which
works as in Java. As usual in Eclipse, pressing the F4 key displays the type
hierarchy pertaining to a class or interface name at the cursor position.
