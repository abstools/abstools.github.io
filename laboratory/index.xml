    <title>The Collaboratory :: The ABS Modeling Language</title>
    <link>https://abs-models.org/laboratory/index.html</link>
    <description>The Collaboratory is a browser-based IDE for ABS that offers an online, zero install version of the ABS toolchain. Use it to experiment with the language in a risk-free environment.&#xA;Load our ready-made examples or run your own ABS models. The editor has many features of an IDE, including showing you an outline of the code, and of course reporting syntax- and type errors.&#xA;The collaboratory also supports many of the analysis tools that we have developed, like COSTA and SACO.</description>
