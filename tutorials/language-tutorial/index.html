<p><img src="/images/fig1.png" alt="The gap in the landscape of software modeling languages" title="The gap in the landscape of software modeling languages" /></p>

<p>ABS fills a <em>gap</em> in the landscape of software modeling languages.  It
is situated between architectural, design-oriented, foundational, and
implementation-oriented languages
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_8">[25]</a> For trying out
the examples provided in this tutorial you will need the ABS Eclipse
plugin. To install it, follow the simple instructions at
<a href="http://tools.hats-project.eu/eclipseplugin/installation.html" title="http://tools.hats-project.eu/eclipseplugin/installation.html">http://tools.</a>
<a href="http://tools.hats-project.eu/eclipseplugin/installation.html" title="http://tools.hats-project.eu/eclipseplugin/installation.html">hats-project.eu/eclipseplugin/installation.html</a>.  You
will need at least Eclipse version 3.6.2 and it is recommended to work
with a clean installation. The example project used throughout this
tutorial is available as an archive from
<a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/TutorialExample.zip">http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/TutorialExample.zip</a>. To
install, unzip the archive file into a directory /mypath/Account. Then
create a new <em>ABS Project</em> and import the directory file contents into
Eclipse workspace in the usual way. After opening a few files in the
editor you should see a screen similar to the one here:</p>

<h2 id="2-design-principles-of-abs">2 Design Principles of ABS</h2>

<p>ABS targets software systems that are concurrent, distributed,
object-oriented, built from components, and highly reusable. To achieve
the latter, we follow the arguably most successful software reuse
methodology in practice: <em>software product families or software product
lines</em> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-28901-1">[35]</a>, see also the
<a href="http://splc.net/fame.html" title="Product Hall of Fame">Product Line Hall of</a>
<a href="http://splc.net/fame.html" title="Product Hall of Fame">Fame</a>. To this end,
ABS supports the modeling of variability in terms of feature models as a
<em>first-class language concept</em>. As shown in Sect. 8, ABS thus provides
language-based support for <em>product line engineering</em> (PLE). As an
abstract language ABS is well suited to model software that is supposed
to be deployed in a virtualized environment. To close the gap between
design and deployment it is necessary to represent low-level concepts
such as system time, memory, latency, or scheduling at the level of
abstract models. In ABS this is possible via a flexible and pluggable
notation called <em>deployment components</em>. This goes beyond the present,
introductory tutorial, but is covered in detail in the chapter by
Johnsen in this volume
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40615-7">[24]</a>. ABS is not merely
a modeling notation, but it arrives with an integrated tool set that
helps to <em>automate the software engineering process</em>. Tools are use-
less, however, unless they ensure <em>predictability of results,
interoperability</em>, and <em>usability</em>. A fundamental requirement for the
first two criteria is a uniform, formal semantics. But
interoperability also involves the capability to connect with other
notations than ABS. This is ensured by providing numerous language in-
terfaces from and to ABS as shown in below. These are
realized by various import, export, and code generation tools, several
of which are discussed below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fig3.png" alt="Interfaces between ABS and other languages" title="Interfaces between ABS and other languages" /></p>

<p>Arguably the most important criterion for tools,
however, is usability. This tutorial is not the place to embark on a
full discussion of what that entails, but it should be indisputable that
<em>automation, scalability</em>, and <em>integration</em> are of the utmost
importance. To ensure the first two of these qualities, the HATS project
adopted as a central principle to develop ABS <em>in tandem</em> with its tool
set. This is not merely a historical footnote, but central to an
understanding of the trade-offs made in the design of the ABS language.
For most specification and programming languages their (automatic)
analyzability is considered in hindsight and turns out not to be
scalable or even feasible. With ABS, the slogan of <em>design for
verifiability</em> that originated in the context of hardware description
languages
<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F0-387-97226-9_20">[30]</a>,
has been systematically applied to a software modeling language. For
example, the concurrency model of ABS is designed such that it permits a
compositional proof system
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2010.08.003">[3]</a>, the reuse
principle employed in ABS is chosen in such a way that incremental
verification is possible
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34026-0_4">[21]</a>, etc. Many
formal methods tools focus on analysis, in particular, on verification.
Functional verification, model checking, test case generation, and
resource estimation are supported by ABS tools as well. Just as
important as analytic methods, specifically in a model-based context,
are <em>generative</em> ones: ABS is fully executable (albeit in a
non-deterministic manner) and supports code generation to Java, Scala,
and Maude. In addition, it is possible to <em>learn</em> ABS models from
observed behavior
<a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/Deliverable3.2.pdf">[16]</a>.
Regarding <em>integration</em>, the tool set around the ABS language is
realized as a set of plugins for the popular Eclipse IDE. These plugins
realize the ABS</p>

<p><img src="/images/fig4.png" alt="Architecture of the ABS language" title="Architecture of the ABS language" /></p>

<p><em>Modeling Perspective</em> (see <a href="ABSModelingPerspective.jpg">Fig.
2</a>) and the <em>ABS Debug Perspective</em> (see
<a href="ABSDebugPerspective.jpg">Fig. 8</a>), which provide the same functionality
as their Java counterparts, that is, parsing, syntax highlighting, parse
error location, symbol lookup, compilation, building, runtime
configurations, interactive debugging, etc. In addition to these
standard development tools, however, a number of analysis and generation
tools are available as well. Some of these, for example, Java code
generation or type inference are illustrated below. An overview of the
ABS tool suite is given in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10009-012-0250-1">[42]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3-architecture-of-abs">3 Architecture of ABS</h2>

<p>The architecture of ABS has been organized as a stack of clearly
separated layers as illustrated in <a href="fig4.png">Fig. 4</a>. In the design we
strove for</p>

<ol>
<li>an attractive, easy-to-learn language with a syntax that is familiar
to many developers and</li>
<li>to provide maximal separation of concern (orthogonality) among
different concepts.</li>
</ol>

<p>The four bottom layers provide a modern programming language based on a
combination of algebraic data types (ADTs), pure functions, and a simple
imperative-OO language. The idea is that anyone familiar with either
Java and Haskell or with Scala is able to grasp this part of ABS
immediately, even though ABS is considerably simpler than any of these
languages. The next two layers realize tightly coupled and distributed
concurrency, respectively. The concurrency and synchronization
constructs are designed in a way to permit a compositional proof theory
for functional verification in a program logic
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2010.08.003">[3]</a>. Standard
contracts are used for functional specification of sequential programs
and behavioral interfaces over sets of histories are used for specifying
concurrent programs, see also the paper by Poetzsch-Heffter in this
volume <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40615-7_3">[34]</a>. The
language layers up to here are often called <em>Core ABS</em>. Above these are
orthogonal extensions for product line engineering, deployment
components, and runtime components that allow to model mobile code. The
latter are not discussed in this volume, but are described in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34026-0_6">[28]</a>. As mentioned
above, ABS is a fully executable language. Nevertheless, <em>abstraction</em>
is achieved in a number of ways: first of all, ABS contains only five
built-in datatypes&mdash;everything else is user-defined. The rationale is
that no premature decision on the properties of datatypes is enforced,
which helps to create implementation-independent models. Second,
functions on datatypes can be <em>underspecified</em>. The modeler has the
alternative to return abstract values or to leave case distinctions
incomplete. The latter may result in runtime errors, but is nev-
ertheless useful for simulation, test generation or verification
scenarios. Third, the scheduling of concurrent tasks as well as the
order of queuing messages is non-deterministic. Of course, one might
want to give full implementation details at some time. This is possible
by refining an ADT into an implemented class or by realizing it in Java
via the <em>foreign language interface</em> available in ABS (Sect. 7. Concrete
schedulers can be specified via deployment components
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40615-7">[24,</a>
<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2245276.2232086">32]</a>. Crucially, the
abstraction capabilities of ABS allow to specify partial behavior
during early design stages, such as feature analysis, without committing
to implementation details. This lends support, for example, to rapid
prototyping or to the early analysis of consequences of design
decisions. ABS has been designed as a compact language. Each layer has
no more first-class concepts than are needed to ensure usability
(including some syntactic sugar). This does not mean, however, that ABS
is a small language: the ABS grammar has considerably more non-terminals
than that of Java! The reason is that ABS features several language
concepts that are simply not present in Java. In the final analysis,
this reflects the ambition of ABS to cover the whole modeling spectrum
from feature analysis, deployment mapping, high-level design and down to
implementation issues. To show that in spite of this ABS is not
unwieldy, but rather easy to use and quite flexible, is the aim of the
present tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="4-1-algebraic-data-types">4.1 Algebraic Data Types</h3>

<p>The base layer of ABS is a simple language for parametric algebraic data
types (ADTs) with a self-explaining syntax. The only predefined
datatypes(Foot: There is one more predefined type that is used for
synchronization which is explained in Sect. 6.) are <strong>Bool,Int, String,
Unit</strong> and parametric lists as defined below. The type <strong>Unit</strong> is used
as a type for methods without return value and works like Java&rsquo;s
<strong>void</strong>. All other types are user-defined. We assume that the Eclipse
plugin is installed (see Sect. 1.3). To create a new ABS file in an
existing ABS project, right click on the project in the explorer and
choose <strong>New|ABS Module</strong>. In the input mask that pops up, specify a
file name, for example, <strong>CustomerData</strong>, and click <strong>Finish</strong>. This
creates a new file named CustomerData.abs in the workspace, which can be
edited in the usual way. The running example of this tutorial has a
banking theme. Let us create some datatypes related to customers. <em>All
type and constructor names must be upper-case</em>.</p>

<pre><code>data Level = Standard | Silver | Gold;
data Customer = Test | Person(Int, Level) | Company(Int);
</code></pre>

<p>There are three kind of customers defined by three different type
constructors: a test customer, individual customers, and corporate
customers. Individual customers are identified by a personal id and
possess a status level while corporate customers are identified by
their vat number. We can make this more explicit and, at the same,
automatically create selector functions for the arguments of each type
constructor by the following alternative definition:</p>

<pre><code>data Customer = Test | Person(Int pid, Level) | Company(Int vat);
</code></pre>

<p>Assume now that we want to define lists of customers. For this we can
use the following built-in parametric list type, which provides a
convenient concrete syntax for lists:</p>

<pre><code>data List&lt;T&gt; = Nil | Cons(T, List&lt;T&gt;);
List&lt;Int&gt; l = [1,2,3];
</code></pre>

<p>The definition of parametric lists demonstrates that type definitions
may be recursive. Let us instantiate parametric lists with <strong>Customer</strong>
and, at the same time, create a <em>type synonym</em>:</p>

<pre><code>type CustomerList = List&lt;Customer&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>Type synonyms do not add new types or functionality, but can greatly en-
hance readability.</p>

<h3 id="4-2-functions">4.2 Functions</h3>

<p>The functional layer of ABS consists of a pure first-order functional
language with definitions by case distinction and pattern matching. All
function names must be lower-case. Let us begin by defining a function
that computes the length of a list of customers:</p>

<pre><code>def Int length(CustomerList list) =
    case list {
       Nil =&gt; 0 ;
       Cons(n, ls) =&gt; 1 + length(ls) ;
       _ =&gt; 0 ;
    } ;
</code></pre>

<p>Several kinds of patterns are permitted on the left-hand side of case
distinctions. In the example above, the first and second cases use a
data constructor pattern. In the second case, this contains an unbound
variable whose value is extracted and used on the right-hand side. The
last case uses an underscore pattern containing an anonymous variable
that matches anything. Naturally, it would have been possible to define
a parametric version of <strong>Int length(List&lt;T&gt; list)</strong>. This is left as
an exercise to the reader. Here is another example illustrating the
remaining patterns, that is, the literal pattern and the bound variable
pattern:</p>

<pre><code>def Int sign(Int n) =
    case n {
       0 =&gt; 0 ;
       n =&gt; if (n &gt; 0) then 1 else -1 ;
    } ;
</code></pre>

<p>The ABS parser does not attempt to establish whether case distinctions
are exhaustive. If no pattern in a case expression matches, a runtime
error results. It is up to the modeler to prevent this situation (in the
near future, ABS will be equipped with the possibility of failure
handling). Similarly, it is perfectly possible to define the following
function:</p>

<pre><code>def Int getPid(Customer c) = pid(c);
</code></pre>

<p>However, if c has any other type than <strong>Person(Int,Level)</strong> at runtime,
an error will result. We close this section by illustrating a piece of
syntactic sugar for associative collection types such as sets, bags,
sequences, etc. To construct concrete elements of such datatypes one
typically needs to iterate several binary constructors, such as
<strong>Insert(1,Insert(2,Insert(3,EmptySet)))</strong>. This is cumbersome. The
following idiom defines an n-ary constructor that uses concrete list
syntax as its argument. By convention, the constructor should have the
same name as the type it is derived from, but in lower-case.</p>

<pre><code>data Set&lt;A&gt; = EmptySet | Insert(A, Set&lt;A&gt;);
def Set&lt;A&gt; set&lt;A&gt;(List&lt;A&gt; l) =
    case l {
       Nil =&gt; EmptySet;
       Cons(hd, tl) =&gt; Insert(hd, set(tl));
    } ;
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/ABSProblemReporting.jpg" alt="Parser error in the ABS Eclipse editor" title="Parser error in the ABS Eclipse editor" /></p>

<p>Errors are highlighted on the editor line where they
occur as well as in the <strong>Problems</strong> tab of the messages subwindow</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;Int&gt; s = set[1,2,3];
</code></pre>

<h3 id="4-3-modules">4.3 Modules</h3>

<p>If you tried to type in the previous examples into the ABS Eclipse
editor you got parser errors despite the definitions being syntactically
correct (similarly as in <a href="ABSProblemReporting.jpg">Fig. 5</a>). This is,
because any ABS definition must be contained in exactly one <em>module</em>.
ABS is equipped with a simple syntactic module system that is inspired
by that of Haskell <a href="http://haskell.org/">[33]</a>. To make the examples
of the previous section work, simply add a <em>module declaration</em> like
this as the first line of the file:</p>

<pre><code>module CustomerData;
</code></pre>

<p>Module names must be upper-case and define a syntactic scope until the
end of the file or until the next module declaration, whatever comes
first. Module names can also be part of qualified type names. Module
declarations are followed by <em>export</em> and <em>import</em> directives. The
former lists the types, type constructors, and functions that are
visible to other modules, the latter lists the entities from other
modules that can be used in the current module. With the type
definitions of the previous section we might write:</p>

<pre><code>module CustomerData;
export Standard, Customer, Company, getPid;
...
module Test;
import * from CustomerData;
def Customer c1() = Company(2);
def Customer c2() = Person(1,Standard); // erroneous
</code></pre>

<p>The module <strong>CustomerData</strong> exposes three of its constructors and a
function while module <strong>Test</strong> imports anything made available by the
former. The definition of <strong>c1</strong> is correct, but the definition of
<strong>c2</strong> gives a parse error about a constructor that cannot be resolved,
because <strong>Person</strong> is not exported. The <strong>from</strong> clause constitutes an
<em>unqualified import</em>. Instead, it is also possible to make <em>qualified</em>
imports. For example, we could have written:</p>

<pre><code>import CustomerData.Company, CustomerData.Customer;
def CustomerData.Customer c1() = CustomerData.Company(2);
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, however, one must also use qualified type names in the
definitions as illustrated above. The ABS compiler knows one predefined
module that does not need to be explicitly imported&mdash;the ABS standard
library <strong>ABS.StdLib</strong>. It contains a number of standard collection
types, such as lists, sets, maps, together with the usual functions
defined on them. It also contains some other types and functions that
are used often. The standard library module is contained in a file named
<strong>abslang.abs</strong>. To look up the definition of any standard type or
function (or any other type or function, for that matter), simply move
the cursor over the identifier in question and press F3. For example,
pressing F3 over the identifier <strong>Cons</strong> in the definition of <strong>length</strong>
in the previous section opens a new tab that contains <strong>abslang.abs</strong>
and jumps to the line that contains the definition of the constructor
<strong>Cons</strong>. This lookup functionality is, of course, well-known to users
of the Eclipse IDE.</p>

<h3 id="4-4-abstract-data-types">4.4 Abstract Data Types</h3>

<p>The module system allows to define <em>abstract data types</em> by hiding the
type constructors. This implies that only functions can be used to
access data elements. Their explicit representation is hidden. Of
course, one then needs to supply suitable constructor functions,
otherwise, no new elements can be created at all. In the example of the
previous section we might decide to expose only the types and
constructor functions as follows:</p>

<pre><code>module CustomerData;
export Customer, Level, createCustomer, createLevel;
def Customer createCustomer(Int id, String kind) = ... ;
def Level createLevel() = ... ;
</code></pre>

<p>We leave it as an exercise to write a suitable definition of
<strong>createCustomer</strong>. As usual, the advantage of using abstract data types
is that one can replace the definition of types without the need to
change any client code.</p>

<h2 id="5-the-oo-imperative-layer">5 The OO-Imperative Layer</h2>

<h3 id="5-1-the-object-model">5.1 The Object Model</h3>

<p>ABS follows a strict <em>programming to interfaces</em> discipline
<a href="http://st-www.cs.illinois.edu/patterns/dpbook/dpbook.html">[17]</a>.
This means that the <em>only</em> declaration types of objects are interface
types. Consequentially, ABS classes do <em>not</em> give rise to type names.
Apart from that, interface declarations are pretty standard and follow a
Java-like syntax. They simply consist of a number of method signatures.
Static fields are not permitted,(Foot: And neither are static classes
and objects. Instead of static elements the ABS modeler should consider
to use ADTs and functions.) but subinterfaces, even multiple
subinterfaces, are permitted. Let us give an example that models the
Customer type from previous sections in an object-oriented fashion:</p>

<pre><code>module CustomerIF;
export Customer;
import Level, createLevel from CustomerData;
interface Customer { Int getId(); }
interface IndvCustomer extends Customer {}
interface CorpCustomer extends Customer { Level getLevel(); }
</code></pre>

<p>As can be seen, interfaces (and also classes) can be exported. In fact,
this is necessary, if anyone outside their modules is to use them. It is
possible to mix object and data types: data types may occur anywhere
within classes and interfaces as long as they are well-typed. Less
obviously, reference types may also occur inside algebraic data types.
As seen earlier, it is perfectly possible to declare the following type:</p>

<pre><code>type CustomerList = List&lt;Customer&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that it is not allowed to call methods in function
definitions. The reason is that method calls might have side effects. It
was mentioned already that classes do not provide type names. They are
only used for object construction. As a consequence, in ABS it is always
possible to decide when a class and when an interface name is expected.
Therefore, interfaces and classes may have the same name. We do not
recommend this, however, because it dilutes the programming to
interfaces discipline. It is suggested to use a base name for the
interface and derive class names by appending &ldquo;Impl&rdquo; or similar. A class
may implement multiple interfaces. Class constructors are not declared
explicitly, instead, class declarations are equipped with parameter dec-
larations that implicitly define corresponding fields and a constructor.
Class definitions then consist of field declarations, followed by an
initialization block and method implementations. Any of these elements
may be missing. Hence, we can continue the example as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class CorpIndvCustomerImpl(Int id) implements IndvCustomer, CorpCustomer {
    Level lv = createLevel();
    // no initialization block
    Level getLevel() { return lv; }
    Int getId() { return id; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the <strong>id</strong> field is modeled as a class parameter, because it is
not possible to give a reasonable default value, which is otherwise
required, because fields that have no reference type must be
initialized. Reference type fields are initialized with <strong>null</strong>. In
contrast to functions, method names need not (and cannot) be exported by
modules. It is sufficient to get hold of an object in order to obtain
access to the methods that are defined in its type. The most striking
difference between ABS and mainstream OO languages is that in ABS there
is <em>no class inheritance</em> and, therefore, also <em>no code inheritance</em>.
So, how do we achieve code reuse? In ABS we decided to disentangle data
design and functionality from the modeling of code variability. For the
former, we use functions and objects (without code inheritance), whereas
for the latter we use a layer on top of the core ABS language that
permits to connect directly with feature models. This layer is discussed
in Sect. 8. In a concurrent setting (see Sect. 6) one typically wants
some objects to start their activity immediately after initialization.
To achieve this in ABS, one can define a <strong>Unit run()</strong> method, which
implicitly declares a class as <em>active</em> and lets objects execute the
code in the body of the run method after initialization. Classes without
a <strong>run()</strong> method are called <em>passive</em> and their objects react only to
incoming calls.</p>

<h3 id="5-2-the-imperative-layer">5.2 The Imperative Layer</h3>

<p>ABS has standard statements for sequential composition, assignment,
while-loops, conditionals, synchronous method calls, and method return.
To illustrate all of these, one can look at the implementation of
method <strong>findCustomer( CustomerList)</strong> in class <strong>CorpIndvCustomerImpl</strong>
(don&rsquo;t forget to add it to the implemented interfaces as well to
render it visible!).</p>

<pre><code>Customer findCustomer(CustomerList cl) {
    Customer result;
    Int i = 0;
    while (i&lt;length(cl)) {
        Customer curCust = nth(cl,i);
        Int curId = curCust.getId();
        if (id==curId) {result = curCust;}
    }
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to the various constructs, we can illustrate several
ABS-specific restrictions: it is necessary that the final statement in
the method body is a return statement with the correct type. A typical
ABS idiom is, therefore, to declare a local <strong>result</strong> variable. Neither
for-loops nor breaks from loops are supported at the moment. To avoid
going through the remaining list after the element has been found, one
would need to add and test for a <strong>Bool found</strong> variable. Complex
expressions are not allowed at the moment in tests of conditionals or
loops. The workaround, as shown here, is to declare a local variable
that holds an intermediate result. While these restrictions can be
slightly annoying they hardly matter very much. It is likely that some
of them will be lifted in the future, once it is better known what
modelers wish. A more fundamental restriction concerns the usage of
fields in assignment statements: assignments to fields and field lookups
are only possible for the current object. Given a field <strong>f</strong>, an
assignment of the form <strong>x = f;</strong> is always implicitly qualified as <strong>x
= this.f;</strong> and an assignment of the form <strong>f = exp;</strong> is always
implicitly qualified as <strong>this.f = exp;</strong>. This implies that fields in
ABS are <em>object private</em>. They cannot be directly seen or be modified by
other objects, not even by objects from the same class (as is possible
even for private fields in Java). In other words, ABS enforces <em>strong
encapsulation</em> of objects: it is only possible to view or change the
state of another object via getter- and setter-methods. For example, it
is not possible to change the second line in the body of the while-loop
of <strong>findCustomer(CustomerList)</strong> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Int curId = curCust.id;
</code></pre>

<p>The designers of ABS consider object encapsulation not as a restriction,
but as a virtue: it makes all cross references between objects
syntactically explicit. This avoids errors that can be hard to find. In
addition it makes static analysis much more efficient, because any cross
reference and possible side effect to a different object can be
associated with a unique method contract. For the practicing ABS modeler
object encapsulation is greatly alleviated by the method completion
feature of the Eclipse editor: if one types the beginning of the example
above &ldquo;<strong>Int curId = curCust</strong>.&ldquo;, then a pop-up menu will offer a
selection of all methods that are known for objects of type
<strong>Customer</strong>, the required getter-method <strong>getId()</strong> among them. If a
suitable method is not found, then the modeler can take this as a hint
that it needs to be implemented or added to the interface. ABS is a
<em>block-structured</em> language. Blocks are delimited by curly braces (no
semicolon afterward) and may appear at four different places in a
program:</p>

<ol>
<li>as a way to group several statements and provide a scope for local
variables&ndash;blocks are necessary for bodies of loops and
conditionals that have more than one statement;</li>
<li>as method bodies;</li>
<li>as the (optional) class initialization block, between field and
method declarations;</li>
<li>as an (optional) implicit &ldquo;main&rdquo; method at end of a module.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last usage serves as an entry point for execution of ABS programs.
At least one main block in one module is necessary for executing an ABS
project, otherwise it is not clear which objects are to be created and
executed. Any module that has a main block is selectable as an execution
target via the Eclipse <strong>Run Configurations ...</strong> dialog or simply by
right clicking on the desired module in the explorer and selection of
<strong>Run As</strong>. We might complete the example by specifying the following
main block for module <strong>CustomerIF</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>{
    Customer c = new CorpIndvCustomerImpl(17); // create some customers
    Customer d = new CorpIndvCustomerImpl(16);
    CustomerList l = Cons(c,Cons(d,Nil)); // create list of customers
    Customer e = c.findCustomer(l); // we should find c in l
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code illustrates at the same time the usage of the <strong>new</strong>
statement, which works as in Java. As usual in Eclipse, pressing the F4
key displays the type hierarchy pertaining to a class or interface name
at the cursor position.</p>

<h2 id="6-the-concurrency-layers">6 The Concurrency Layers</h2>

<h3 id="6-1-background">6.1 Background</h3>

<p>One of the most distinctive features of ABS is its concurrency model. If
we look at commercial programming languages such as C, C++, or Java, one
can observe that, despite intense efforts in the last decade, none of
them has a fully formalized concurrency model. Even though there are
promising efforts towards a formal concurrency model of Java
<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2103776.2103785">[5]</a>, the details are so
complex that they are likely to compromise usability of any resulting
system. The reason is that current industrial programming languages have
a very low-level concurrency model and do not natively support
distributed computation. This has practical consequences, such as
burdening the programmer with, for example, prevention of data races. A
more fundamental problem is the impossibility to design a compositional
proof system for such languages. By <em>compositionality</em> we mean that one
can specify and verify the behavior of a single method in isolation from
the rest of the system. This is a prerequisite for being able to deduce
global behavior from the composition of local behavior. In a setting,
where concurrent objects can arbitrarily cross-reference each other,
this is hardly possible.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fig6.png" alt="Illustration of an ABS Component Group" title="Illustration of an ABS Component Group" /></p>

<p>Arbitrarily complex, global invariants, might be needed to describe
behavior. One approach to tackle the problem is to impose structure on
concurrent objects and to make their dependencies syntactically
explicit. In the realm of Java, JCoBox
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14107-2_13">[39]</a> is a suitable
framework. It has been simplified and renamed into <em>Concurrent Object
Group</em> (COG) in the context of ABS. COGs constitute the <em>lower tier</em> of
the ABS concurrency model and are intended for closely cooperating
concurrent tasks. A second shortcoming of mainstream programming
languages is the lack of support for distributed computation, that is,
asynchronous communication among nodes that do not share memory. This
form of concurrency has been abstracted into the <em>Actor</em> model
<a href="http://ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-73/PDF/027B.pdf">[23]</a> and
is realized with first-class support in recent languages such as Scala.
ABS implements a version of Actor-based distributed computation where
COGs form the primitive units of distribution. This constitutes the
<em>upper</em> tier of the ABS concurrency model. Its main ideas are derived
from the modeling language Creol
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2006.07.031">[26]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="6-2-component-object-groups">6.2 Component Object Groups</h3>

<p>An ABS Concurrent Object Group (COG) is a collection of tasks with
shared memory and processor. This means that exactly one task is active
at any given time and tasks can cross-reference each other. The
situation can be visualized as in <a href="fig6.png">Fig. 6</a>. Within a COG,
synchronous as well as asynchronous method calls are permitted. For
the former, we use the standard syntax
<strong>target.method(arg1,arg2,...)</strong>. <em>Synchronous method calls</em> within
COGs represent sequential execution of code, that is, they block the
caller and execute the code of the target until control is returned.
<em>Asynchronous method calls</em> use the syntax
<strong>target!method(arg1,arg2,...)</strong> and they cause the creation of a new
task that is to execute the code of the target. Unlike in synchronous
calls, execution of the code of the caller continues. The main point to
understand about COGs is that multitasking is not <em>preemptive</em>
(decided by a scheduler). Rather it is an explicit decision of the ABS
modeler when control is transferred to another task. To this end, ABS
provides scheduling statements that allow <em>cooperative multitasking</em>. In
between the explicit scheduling points, only one task is active,
signified by the (single) <em>lock</em> of a COG being set to &amp;#8868. As a
consequence, data races between synchronization points simply cannot
happen, which was an important design goal of ABS.</p>

<h3 id="6-3-scheduling-and-synchronization">6.3 Scheduling and Synchronization</h3>

<p>So, how are scheduling points specified in ABS? It is here that we
encounter a second, central concurrency principle of ABS: <em>communication
and synchronization are decoupled</em>. This is done via <em>future types</em>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-71316-6_22">[12]</a>. For any ABS
type <strong>T</strong> a legal type name is <strong>Fut&lt;T&gt;</strong> and one can assign to it
the result of any asynchronous method call with return type <strong>T</strong>. A
variable declared with type <strong>Fut&lt;T&gt;</strong> serves as a reference to the
future result of an asynchronous call and allows to retrieve it once it
will have been computed. For example, the final line of the example on
p. 15 can be rewritten to:</p>

<pre><code>Fut&lt;Customer&gt; e = c!findCustomer(l);
// do something else ...
</code></pre>

<p>Now the call creates a new task in the current COG and declares <strong>e</strong> as
a future reference to its final result. The following code is executed
immediately. The future mechanism allows to dispatch asynchronous calls,
continue with the execution, and then synchronize on the result,
whenever it is needed. Synchronization is achieved by the command
<strong>await g</strong>, where <strong>g</strong> is a polling <em>guard</em>. A guard is a conjunction
of either side-effect free boolean expressions or <em>future guards</em> of the
form <strong>f?</strong>. In the latter, <strong>f</strong> is a variable that has a future type.
If the result to which <strong>f?</strong> is a reference is ready and available,
then the expression evaluates to true. When the guard of an await
statement evaluates to true, the computation simply continues. If,
however, a guard is not true, then the current task releases the lock of
its COG and gives another task in that COG the chance to continue. When
later the task is scheduled gain, the guard is re-evaluated, and so on,
until it finally becomes true. We call this a <em>conditional scheduling
point</em> or <em>conditional release point</em>. To continue the previous example
we could write:</p>

<pre><code>await e?;
</code></pre>

<p>If the asynchronous call to <strong>findCustomer(l)</strong> has finished, then
execution simply continues. Otherwise, the lock of the current COG is
set to ⊥ and the processor is free to proceed with another task. For
efficiency reasons ABS allows only <em>monotonic</em> guards and only
conjunctive composition. Once the result from an asynchronous call is
available, it can be retrieved with a <strong>get</strong>-expression that has a
future variable as its argument. In the example this may look as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>Customer f = e.get;
</code></pre>

<p>In summary, the following programming idiom for asynchronous calls and
retrieving their results is common in ABS:</p>

<pre><code>Fut&lt;T&gt; v = o!m(e); ... ; await v?; r = v.get;
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/fig7.png" alt="Illustration of object and COG creation (gray boundaries represent COGs)" title="Illustration of object and COG creation; gray boundaries represent COGs" /></p>

<p>ABS does not attempt to check that each <strong>get</strong> expression is guarded
by an <strong>await</strong> statement. So what happens when the result of an
asynchronous call is not ready when <strong>get</strong> is executed? The answer is
that the execution of the COG <em>blocks</em>. The difference between
suspension and blocking is that in the latter case <em>no</em> task in same
COG can continue until the blocking future is resolved. Sometimes it
is convenient to create an <em>unconditional scheduling point</em>, for
example, to insert release points into long running sequential
tasks. The syntax for unconditional scheduling statements in ABS is
&ldquo;<strong>suspend;</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="6-4-object-and-cog-creation">6.4 Object and COG Creation</h3>

<p>In the previous section we discussed the fundamental concurrency model
of ABS, which is based on COGs. Whenever we create an object with the
<strong>new</strong> statement, it is by default created in the same COG as the
current task (see upper part of <a href="fig7.png">Fig. 7</a>). This is not
adequate for modeling <em>distributed computing</em>, where each node has its
own computing resources (processor) and nodes are loosely coupled. In an
ABS model of a distributed scenario we associate one COG with each node.
New COGs are implicitly created when specifying the <strong>cog</strong> keyword at
object creation (see lower part of <a href="fig7.png">Fig. 7</a>): this creates a
new COG and places the new object inside it. At the moment, COGs are not
first-class objects in ABS and are accessible only implicitly through
their objects.(Foot: There is an extension for ABS runtime objects that
allows explicit and dynamic grouping of COGs
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34026-0_6">[28]</a>.) As a
consequence, it is not possible to re-enter via recursive calls into the
same execution thread. This is the reason why a simple binary lock for
each COG is sufficient. Let us extend our running example with an
<strong>Account</strong> class and COG creation:</p>

<pre><code>module Account;
interface Account {
    Int getAid();
    Int deposit(Int x);
    Int withdraw(Int x);
}

class AccountImpl(Int aid, Int balance, Customer owner)
implements Account { ... }

{
    [Near] Customer c = new CorpIndvCustomerImpl(3);
    [Far] Account a = new cog AccountImpl(1,0,c);
    Fut&lt;Int&gt; dep = a!deposit(17);
    Fut&lt;Int&gt; with = a!withdraw(17);
    await dep? &amp; with?;
    Int x = dep.get;
    Int y = with.get;
    Int net = x + y;
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/ABSDebugPerspective.jpg" alt="Screenshot of ABS Debug Perspective in Eclipse plugin" title="Screenshot of ABS Debug Perspective in Eclipse plugin" /></p>

<p>We create an account objects in a different COG from the current one.
Note that there is no sharing of objects between COGs, so that the
variable c provides no alias to the object parameter c in the
constructor <strong>AccountImpl(1,0,c)</strong>. The tasks resulting from the two
asynchronous calls will be executed on the same node, which is different
from the current one. A conjunctive guard ensures that the retrieval of
the results is safe. It is possible to <em>visualize</em> the execution of ABS
code in two ways. To start the graphical ABS Debugger, simply right
click on the file with the <strong>Account</strong> module in the explorer and select
<strong>Run As|ABS Java Backend (Debug)</strong>. This will automatically switch to
the ABS Debug Perspective (see <a href="ABSDebugPerspective.jpg">Fig. 8</a>) and
start the Eclipse debugger.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ABSSequenceDiagram.jpg" alt="Sequence diagram generated from an ABS simulation" title="Sequence diagram generated from an ABS simulation" /></p>

<p>All the usual
features of a graphical debugger are available: navigation, breakpoints,
state inspection, etc. If instead, the backend <strong>Run As|ABS Java
Backend (Debug with Sequence Diagram)</strong> is chosen, then in addition a
UML sequence diagram that has a lifeline for each created COG is created
and dynamically updated after each debugger step, see <a href="ABSSequenceDiagram.jpg">Fig.
9</a>. Synchronous method calls to targets not in
the current COG make no sense and are forbidden. For example, if we
replace one of the asynchronous calls above with <strong>a.deposit(17)</strong>, a
runtime error results. One possibility to avoid this is to <em>annotate</em>
declarations with one of the types <strong>Near</strong> or <strong>Far</strong>, as shown above.
This tells the compiler that, for example, <strong>a</strong> is in a different COG
and cannot be the target of a synchronous call. Obviously, it is tedious
to annotate all declarations; moreover, the annotations tend to clutter
the models. To address this problem, ABS implements a far/near analysis,
which automatically <em>infers</em> a safely approximated (in case of doubt,
use &ldquo;far&rdquo;) location type
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21952-8_15">[41]</a>. The inferred
types are displayed in the Eclipse editor as superscripts (&ldquo;N&rdquo; for near,
&ldquo;F&rdquo; for far) above the declared types. All annotations in the example
can be inferred automatically: simply delete the annotations to see
it. It is also possible to annotate a declaration with <strong>Somewhere</strong>,
which overrides the type inference mechanism and tells the compiler not
to make any assumptions. Default is the annotation <strong>Infer</strong>, but this
can be changed in the ABS project properties. It is entirely possible
that execution of an ABS model results in a <em>deadlock</em> during runtime,
as is exemplified by the model in Fig. 10. Objects <strong>c</strong>, <strong>e</strong> and
<strong>d</strong> are in different COGs, say cog_c and cog_d . The task that
executes <strong>m1</strong> is in cog_c while the task executing <strong>m2</strong> is put into
the second COG cog_d . During this execution <strong>m3</strong> is called on <strong>e</strong>,
which is located in the first COG cog_c . For <strong>m3</strong> to proceed it
needs to obtain the lock of cog_c , but this is not possible, because
<strong>m1</strong> still waits for the result of <strong>m2</strong>. Hence, neither COG can
progress. Deadlocks are very difficult to avoid in general.
Deadlock-free concurrent languages tend to be too restrictive to be
usable and, unlike data race-freeness, are not a practical option.</p>

<pre><code>class C {
    C m1(C b, C c) { Fut&lt;C&gt; r = b!m2(c); return r.get; }
    C m2(C c) { Fut&lt;C&gt; r = c!m3(); return r.get; }
    C m3() { return new C(); }
}
{
    C c = new C(); C d = new cog C(); C e = new C();
    c!m1(d,e);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Fig. 10.</strong> Example for deadlock in ABS</p>

<p>In
ABS many deadlocks can be avoided by supplying enough release points. In
the example above it is sufficient to guard one of the <strong>get</strong>
expressions. In addition, there is an automatic deadlock analysis for
ABS <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21461-5_11">[18]</a> that is
currently being implemented.</p>

<h3 id="6-5-formal-semantics-of-concurrent-abs">6.5 Formal Semantics of Concurrent ABS</h3>

<p>The ABS language has a mathematically rigorous, SOS-style semantics
<a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/Deliverable12.pdf">[13,</a>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_8">25]</a>. This tutorial
introduction is not the place go into the details, but we sketch the
main ideas. The central issue is to give an appropriate structure to the
terms that represent ABS <em>runtime configurations</em>. They are collections
over the following items:</p>

<p><img src="/images/6.5.cogs_.png" alt="Cogs" title="Cogs" /></p>

<p><strong>COGs</strong> are identified simply by a name <em>b</em> for their <em>lock</em> whose
value can be either ⊤ or ⊥. <strong>Objects</strong> have a name <em>o</em>, need to have
a reference to their COG <em>b</em>, to their class <em>C</em>, and they also have a
local state σ that holds the current field values. <strong>Tasks</strong> have a
name n, a reference to their COG b and to the object o whose code they
are executing. They also have a state σ withe values of local
variables and a <em>program counter s</em> that gives the next executable
instruction. Task names <em>n</em> also double as futures, because they
contain exactly the required information. A runtime configuration may
consist of any number of the above items. The operational semantics of
ABS is given by rewrite rules that match the next executable statement
of a task (and thereby also the current COG and object). A typical
example is the rewrite rule that realizes <em>creation of a new COG</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/6.5.formula.png" alt="formula" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>\(b&rsquo;, o&rsquo;, n&rsquo;\) new;</p></li>

<li><p>\(\overline{T f}; s&rsquo;\) init block of class \(C\) and \(\sigma&rsquo;_{init}\) binds constructor parameters \(v&rsquo;\);</p></li>

<li><p>\(\sigma&rsquo;_{init} = \overline{T f}\);</p></li>

<li><p>\(s_{task} = s&rsquo;\{\mathbf{this}\, / o&rsquo;;\mathbf{suspend}\}\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The rule matches a new cog statement in task \(n\), COG \(b\),
current object \(o\), and subsequent statements <code>s</code>.  First we
need to create a new COG with a fresh name \(b&rsquo;\) and a new object
\(o&rsquo;\) of class \(C\).  The new COG starts immediately to execute
the initialization code of its class \(C\) in a new task \(n&rsquo;\),
therefore, the lock of \(b&rsquo;\) is set to ⊤.  Note that the current
object this must be instantiated now to the actual object \(o&rsquo;\).  After
initialization, execution is suspended.  The original task \(n\)
immediately continues to execute the remaining code <code>s</code> as there is no
release point here.  The value of the object reference <code>z</code> is replaced
with the new object \(o&rsquo;\).</p>

<h3 id="7-1-pluggable-type-system">7.1 Pluggable Type System</h3>

<p>All declarations (fields, methods, classes, interfaces) in ABS can carry
annotations. These are simply expressions that are enclosed in square
brackets. The location type system in Sect. 6.4 provided examples. Other
annotations can be logical expressions that are used as assertions,
contracts, or invariants during verification or runtime assertion
checking. This goes beyond this tutorial. The location types are a
so-called pluggable type system. Such type systems can be realized
easily in ABS via meta annotations. The special annotation
[TypeAnnotation] declares the data type definition immediately
following it to be a definition for type annotations and makes the
parser aware of it. For example, the location type system is declared as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>[TypeAnnotation]
data LocationType = Far | Near | Somewhere | Infer;
// usage
[LocationType: Near] T n;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="7-2-foreign-language-interface">7.2 Foreign Language Interface</h3>

<p>As a modeling language ABS does not contain mechanisms for I/O, because
these are typically implementation-dependent. Of course, one often would
like to have some output from the execution of an ABS model. This is
possible with a general foreign language interface (FLI) mechanism that
not only can be used to implement I/O for ABS, but to connect ABS models
with legacy code in implementation languages in general. At the moment,
the ABS FLI is realized for the Java language. An ABS class that is to
be implemented in Java needs three ingredients:</p>

<ol>
<li>import of helper functions and classes from the module ABS.FLI;</li>
<li>declaration as being foreign by the annotation [Foreign];</li>
<li>default ABS implementations of all interface methods.</li>
</ol>

<p>A simple example can look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>import * from ABS.FLI;
interface Hello { String hello(String msg); }
[Foreign]
class HelloImpl implements Hello {
    String hello(String msg) { return &quot;default implementation&quot;; }
}
{
    Hello h = new HelloImpl();
    h.hello(&quot;Hi there&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The default implementation is used for simulation of ABS code without
Java. It is now possible to implement a Java version of the HelloImpl
class in a Java project and to connect that project with ABS. The
details of how this is done are explained at the HATS tools site.
Basically, one extends the Java class HelloImpl_c that was generated by
the ABS Java backend with a new implementation of the Java method
hello(String). By convention, the Java methods carry the prefix fli.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">import abs.backend.java.lib.types.ABSString;
import abs.backend.java.lib.runtime.FLIHelper;
import Test.HelloImpl_c;
public class HelloImpl_fli extends HelloImpl_c {
   @Override
   public ABSString fli_hello(ABSString msg) {
      FLIHelper.println(&quot;I got &quot;+msg.getString()+&quot; from ABS&quot;);
      return ABSString.fromString(&quot;Hello ABS, this is Java&quot;);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>On the Java side any Java construct can be used. ABS provides a Java
package abs.backend.java.lib.types containing declarations of the
built-in ABS types usable in Java such as ABSString. Execution of the
ABS main block above will now cause the Java output &ldquo;I got Hi there from
ABS&rdquo; to be printed on the system console.</p>

<h3 id="8-1-product-line-engineering">8.1 Product Line Engineering</h3>

<p><img src="/images/fig11.png" alt="Product line engineering" title="Product line engineering" /></p>

<p>One of the aims of ABS is to provide a uniform and formal framework for
product line engineering (PLE)
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-28901-1">[35]</a>, a practically highly
successful software reuse methodology. In PLE one distinguishes two
separate development phases (see <a href="fig11.png">Fig. 11</a>). During family
engineering one attempts to distill the commonality among different
products into a set of reusable artifacts. At the same time, the
variability of the product line is carefully planned. This is typically
done in a feature-driven manner, and the relation of features, as well
as constraints in their combination is documented in a feature model
with the help of feature description languages
<a href="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/RE.2006.23">[40]</a>. In the
application engineering phase, individual products are being built by
selecting features and by combining the artifacts that implement them in
a suitable way. One drawback of current practice in PLE is that feature
description languages make no formal connection between features and
their implementation. This renders products assembly ad hoc and
error-prone. That issue is addressed in ABS with language extensions for
modeling of features, for connecting features to their realization, as
well as for feature selection and product specification
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11">[10]</a>. In this
section we introduce the PLE extensions of ABS. A fuller discussion of
various approaches to achieve greater flexibility in object-oriented
modeling is contained in the chapter by Clarke in this volume
<a href="http://ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-73/PDF/027B.pdf%20">[8]</a>.
If one wants to maintain a connection between features and code, then
the central issue are the mechanisms being used to compose the code
corresponding to new features with the existing code. In current
practice, this is often done by &ldquo;glue code&rdquo; written in scripting
languages. ABS has the ambition that models can be statically analyzed.
This means that the feature composition mechanism must be
well-structured and represent a suitable match for the analysis methods
used in ABS
<a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/Deliverable27.pdf">[14]</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fig12.png" alt="Graphical representation of the Account feature model" title="Graphical representation of the Account feature model" /></p>

<p>Such a mechanism is delta-oriented programming (DOP)
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-15579-6_6">[36,</a>
<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-557/paper3.pdf%20">38]</a>, because it allows to
modify object-oriented code in a structured manner at the granularity
of fields and methods, which is adequate for the contract-based
specification approach in ABS
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34026-0_4">[21]</a>. To summarize,
the ABS-extensions used to model product lines consist of four
elements <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21455-4_13">[9,</a>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11">10]</a>, which we
describe now in turn:</p>

<ol>
<li>A feature description language</li>
<li>A language for deltas that modify ABS models</li>
<li>A configuration language connecting features with the deltas that realize them</li>
<li>A language for product configuration</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="8-2-feature-description">8.2 Feature Description</h3>

<p>Modern software development processes, notably agile processes and PLE,
tend to be feature-driven. A number of mature and useful formalisms for
feature description have been developed in the last decade. For ABS we
use a slight modification of the textual variability language (TVL)
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2010.10.005">[11]</a>, which has the
advantage of having a formal semantics and a textual representation.
The feature description language used in ABS is called μTVL and differs
from TVL in that (i) attribute types that are not needed are omitted and
(ii) the possibility to have multiple root features. These are useful to
model orthogonal variability in product lines. Let us build a product
line based on the Account interface from Sect. 6.4. Assume we want to
distinguish between checking and saving accounts. The latter may pay
interest, whereas the former usually don&rsquo;t. Optionally, a checking ac-
count (but not a saving account) may permit an overdraft or incur fees
for transactions. A graphical representation of the Account feature
model is in <a href="fig12.png">Fig. 12</a>. The textual rendering in μTVL looks as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>root Account {
   group allof {
      Type {
         group oneof {
            Check {ifin: Type.i == 0;},
            Save {ifin: Type.i &gt; 0;
            exclude: Overdraft;}
         }
         Int i; // interest rate
      },
      opt Fee {Int amount in [0..5];},
      opt Overdraft
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In μTVL one represents each subhierarchy in the feature tree by a group
of features, which can be further qualified as inclusive (allof) or
alternative (oneof). Within a group there is a comma-separated list of
feature declarations. Each feature declaration may be optional (opt) and
have restrictions (ifin:), exclusions (exclude:), or requirements
(include:). Feature parameters are declared after the declaration of a
subhierarchy. A feature model appears in a separate file with extension
.abs. The Eclipse editor supports syntax and parse error highlighting.
There can be several feature files with feature declarations. These are
interpreted as orthogonal feature hierarchies that are all part of the
same feature model. The semantics of feature models is straightforward
by translation into a boolean/integer constraint formula, see
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11">[10,</a>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2010.10.005">11]</a>. For example, the
feature model above is characterized by the following formula: 0 ≤
Account ≤ 1 ∧ Type → Account ∧ Overdraft† → Account ∧ Fee† → Account ∧
Type + Fee† + Overdraft† = 3 ∧ 0 ≤ Type ≤ 1 ∧ Check → Type ∧ Save → Type
∧ Save → ¬Overdraft ∧ Check + Save = 1 ∧ 0 ≤ Check ≤ 1 ∧ 0 ≤ Save ≤ 1 ∧
0 ≤ Fee† ≤ 1 ∧ 0 ≤ Overdraft† ≤ 1 ∧ Fee → Fee† ∧ Overdraft → Overdraft†
∧ 0 ≤ Save ≤ 1 ∧ 0 ≤ Check ≤ 1 ∧ Fee → (Fee.amount &gt;= 0 ∧ Fee.amount
&lt;= 5) ∧ Check → (Type.i = 0) ∧ Save → (Type.i &gt; 0). It is easy to
check validity of a given feature selection for a feature model F : for
any selected feature f and parameter value p := v one simply adds f = 1
∧ p = v to the semantics of F and checks for satisfiability with a
constraint solver. The constraint solver of ABS can:</p>

<ul>
<li>find all possible solutions for a given feature model and</li>
<li>check whether a feature selection is a solution of a feature model.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter check is
performed implicitly in the ABS Eclipse plugin, whenever the user
requests to build a product based on a specific feature selection (see
Sect. 8.5).</p>

<h3 id="8-3-delta-modeling">8.3 Delta Modeling</h3>

<p><img src="/images/fig13.png" alt="Application of delta modules to a core product" title="Application of delta modules to a core product" /></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the realization of features in ABS is done with
delta modules (or deltas, for short), a variant of delta-oriented
programming (DOP). This constitutes the main reuse principle of ABS and
replaces other mechanisms such as code inheritance, traits, or mixins.
In delta modeling we assume that one outcome of the family engineering
phase (see <a href="fig11.png">Fig. 11</a>) is a core or base product with minimal
functionality. Product variants with additional features are obtained
from it by applying one or more deltas that realize the desired
features, as illustrated in <a href="fig13.png">Fig. 13</a>. In ABS, deltas have
the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delta modules may add, remove or modify classes and interfaces</li>
<li>Permitted class modifications are:

<ul>
<li>adding and removal of fields</li>
<li>adding, removal and modification of methods</li>
<li>extending the list of implemented interfaces</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The actual reuse mechanism
is located in the modification of methods: the description of a method
modification in a delta can access the most recent incarnation of that
method in a previous delta by the statement <code>original(...);</code>. This will
cause the compiler to insert the body of the referred method at the time
when the deltas are applied. The signature of <code>original()</code> must be identical to the one of the modified method. The compiler checks the
applicability of deltas and ensures well-typedness of the resulting
code. It is because of this reuse mechanism that once can say that the
granularity of delta application is at the level of methods. There is a
certain analogy between <code>original()</code> in DOP and <code>super()</code>-calls in OO
languages with code inheritance. The crucial difference is that
<code>original()</code> references are resolved at compile time (product build time),
while <code>super()</code>-calls occur at runtime. As a consequence, there is a
runtime penalty for the latter. Assume we have the following
implementation of the withdraw(Int) method of the Account interface,
which ensures that we cannot withdraw more than the current balance:</p>

<pre><code>class AccountImpl(Int aid, Int balance, Customer owner)
implements Account {
   Int withdraw(Int x) {
      if (balance - x &gt;= 0) { balance = balance - x; }
      return balance;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we would like to create a delta module that realizes the feature
Fee. We need to modify withdraw(Int), which can be achieved by the
following delta:</p>

<pre><code>delta DFee(Int fee); // Implements feature Fee
uses Account;
modifies class AccountImpl {
   modifies Int withdraw(Int x) {
      Int result = x;
      if (x&gt;=fee) result = original(x+fee);
      return result;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One or more features can be put into a file with extension .abs. The
connection between different deltas and a base implementation is given
via the uses clause that refers to the module where the base is found.
Like classes, deltas can have parameters, however, these are not fields,
but are instantiated at product build time. Normally, there is a
correspondence between the parameters of deltas and those of the
features they are supposed to implement. The modified withdraw(Int)
method is implemented by a suitable call to the original version after a
check that the withdrawn amount is not trivially small. We must declare
a result variable to ensure that the return statement is last. Assume
further we want to realize the Save feature. One must ensure that the
interest rate is set to 0. ABS deltas at this time do not support to add
or modify class initialization blocks. To change the initial value of a
field, we simply remove the field declaration and add it again with a
suitable initial value:</p>

<pre><code>delta DSave(Int i); // Implements feature Save
uses Account;
modifies class AccountImpl {
   removes Int interest;
   adds Int interest = i;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, we assume here that the interest field has been added in the
first place in the earlier delta DType. This requires to specify and
check temporal constraints on the application of deltas as we shall see
in the following section. Application of a concrete delta is illustrated
with DSave in <a href="fig14.png">Fig. 14</a>. Syntax and parse error highlighting
for delta modules works as usual. Automatic completion works as well,
but it is only done relative to the base product.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fig14.png" alt="Application of delta DSave" title="Application of delta DSave" /></p>

<p>The reason is that before product
build time, the compiler cannot know which deltas have been applied
before. For the same reason, only a limited amount of type checking is
done. Research to lift type checking to the family level is under way
<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2110147.2110161">[29,</a>
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00236-012-0173-z">37]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="8-4-product-line-configuration">8.4 Product Line Configuration</h3>

<p><img src="/images/fig15.png" alt="Schema of product line configuration in ABS" title="Schema of product line configuration in ABS" /></p>

<p>So far, we have two models relating to product lines: the feature model
and the delta model, that is, the feature implementation. Unlike any
other formalism we are aware of, in ABS we can make a formal connection
between these. This is the key to being able to analyze whole product
lines and not merely individual products. In ABS, the connection between
features and their realization (illustrated in <a href="fig15.png">Fig. 15</a>) is
done in a dedicated product line configuration file. This makes
debugging easy, because all information about the realization of a given
feature model is collected in one place. To establish a connection
between features and deltas, the configuration files need to specify
three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>they must associate features with their implementing delta modules
by application conditions;</li>
<li>they need to resolve conflicts in the application order by giving
partial temporal constraints on delta application;</li>
<li>they need to pass the attribute values of features to the parameters
of the delta modules.</li>
</ol>

<p>We can illustrate all three aspects with our running example. The
following file (again, use file extension .abs) defines a product line
named Accounts based on the five features of the feature model in <a href="fig12.png">Fig.
12</a>.</p>

<pre><code>productline Accounts;
features Type, Fee, Overdraft, Check, Save;
delta DType (Type.i) when Type;
delta DFee (Fee.amount) when Fee;
delta DOverdraft after DCheck when Overdraft;
delta DSave (Type.i) after DType when Save;
delta DCheck after DType when Check;
</code></pre>

<p>For each delta that is to be used for implementing any of the features
one specifies:</p>

<ul>
<li>the application conditions (when clauses), that is, the feature(s) that are being realized by each delta and whose presence triggers delta application;</li>
<li>the delta parameters which are derived from feature attribute values;</li>
<li>a strict partial order of delta application (after clauses) to ensure well-definedness of delta applications and resolve conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example, there is a one-to-one correspondence between deltas and
features, which is reflected in the application conditions. Likewise,
the feature attributes Type.i and Fee.amount directly can be used as
parameters of the corresponding deltas. The temporal constraints of
DSave and DCheck ensure that the field interest is present. The
constraint of DOverdraft makes sure that this delta is only applied to
checking accounts. It would also have been possible to express this
constraint at the level of the feature model with an includes: clause.
It is up to the modeler to decide whether a given constraint is a
property of the feature model or of the product line.</p>

<h3 id="8-5-product-selection">8.5 Product Selection</h3>

<p>The final step in PLE with ABS is product selection. Whereas the
activities that took place until now can be viewed as mostly being part
of family engineering, the selection process is always part of
application engineering.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fig16.png" alt="The role of product line configuration in product selection and
compilation" title="The role of product line configuration in product selection and
compilation" /></p>

<p>To create a product it is sufficient to list the features
that should be realized in it and to instantiate the feature attributes
with concrete values. The syntax is very simple and self-explaining. As
any other ABS file, product selection files have the .abs extension and
there is Eclipse support for syntax and parse error highlighting. Some
examples for the Accounts product line are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>product CheckingAccount (Type{i=0},Check);
product AccountWithFee (Type{i=0},Check,Fee{amount=1});
product AccountWithOverdraft (Type{i=0},Check,Overdraft);
product SavingWithOverdraft (Type{i=1},Save,Overdraft);
</code></pre>

<p>The simplest product that can be built is CheckingAccount. The second
product above extends it by charging a fee of one unit per
transaction. The ABS compiler uses the product selection file and the
other related files to create a &ldquo;flattened&rdquo; ABS model where all deltas
have been applied such that it contains only core ABS code. In a first
step, the compiler checks that the product selection is valid for the
given feature model as described in Sect. 8.2. It then uses the product
line configuration file to decide which deltas need to be applied and
how they are instantiated. The partial order on the deltas is
linearized. It is up to the modeller to ensure (possibly, by adding
temporal constraints) that different linearizations do not lead to
conflicting results. Finally, the resulting core ABS model is
type-checked and compiled to one of the ABS backends in the standard
way. As all parts of the ABS language the product line modeling
languages have a formal semantics&mdash;the details are found in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11">[10]</a>. Different
products can be selected in the Run|Run Configurations ... dialog from
the ABS Product menu. Invalid product selections or type errors in the
configuration files will be displayed at this stage. For example,
selection of the SavingWithOverdraft product above results in an error,
because the constraints in the feature model are not satisfied.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fig17.png" alt="Choice of different layers when modeling with ABS" title="Choice of different layers when modeling with ABS" /></p>

<p>After
selection of a valid product one can run and debug the
resulting core ABS model as described earlier. The ABS compiler
additionally creates always as base product that corresponds to the
given ABS model without any features or deltas. This product appears
under the name &lt;base&gt; in the product selection menu. If we execute the
main class of the Account module in Sect. 6.4 in the base product, we
obtain the result 37 in the variable net, whereas if we run the product
AccountWithFee, we obtain 34. A current limitation of the Eclipse ABS
plugin is that the debugger correctly displays the runtime configuration
and the values of variables of products, but in the editor window only
the core product is displayed.</p>

<h2 id="9-concluding-remarks">9 Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>In this tutorial we gave an introduction to the abstract modeling
language ABS. Uniquely among current modeling languages, ABS has a
formal semantics and covers the whole spectrum from feature modeling to
the generation of executable code in Java. Development of ABS models is
supported by an Eclipse plugin. A very important point is that ABS
offers a wide variety of modeling options in a uniform, homogeneous
framework, see <a href="fig17.png">Fig. 17</a>. This allows to select an
appropriate modeling style for each modeled artifact. It also supports
rapid prototyping and design-time analysis, because ADT-based models can
be refined later (dashed arrow). Of course, as any other formalism, ABS
has also limitations: it is not suitable to model low-level,
thread-based concurrency with shared data. Hence, ABS is not suitable to
model multi-core applications or system libraries. In this sense,
approaches such as <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2103776.2103785">[5]</a>
are complementary to ABS. As mentioned earlier, the analysis
capabilities and the ABS runtime component layer are beyond this
tutorial, but some chapters in this volume cover part of the material.</p>

<p>The development and implementation of ABS was a collaborative effort of
the many researchers involved in the HATS project. While the text of
this tutorial has been written from scratch by the author, it could
never have been done without the background of all the papers,
presentations, and discussions provided by many colleagues. Special
thanks go to the main contributors to Work Package 8: Frank de Boer,
Einar Broch Johnsen, and Ina Schaefer.</p>

<h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3>

<p>This paper is a tutorial on ABS and not a language specification nor a
formal definition. A more technical and more detailed description of ABS
and its tool set is contained in the paper trio
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_11">[10,</a>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35887-6_6">20,</a>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_8">25]</a>. The most detailed
document about ABS that also contains a formal semantics is
<a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/Deliverable12.pdf">[13]</a>.
The official ABS Language
Specification is
<a href="http://tools.hats-project.eu/download/absrefmanual.pdf">[2]</a>.
Finally, for several case studies done with ABS, please look here
<a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/Deliverable5.3.pdf">[15]</a>.
It is stressed at several places in this tutorial that ABS has been
designed with the goal of permitting automatic static analyses of
various kinds. This tutorial concentrates on the ABS language and its
development environment. In the paper by Albert in this volume
<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40615-7_4">[4]</a>
automated resource analysis for ABS is explained in detail. Information
on deadlock analysis and formal verification of ABS can be found in
<a href="http://www.hats-project.eu/sites/default/files/Deliverable27.pdf">[14]</a>.
The chapter by Poetzsch-Heffter in this volume
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40615-7_3">[34]</a> contains a
general discussion of verification of concurrent open systems.</p>
